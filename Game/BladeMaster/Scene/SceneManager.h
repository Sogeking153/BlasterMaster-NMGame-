/*
	Approach 1:
	Our main goal is to create a scene manager with no limit to the number of elements and distinct elements it 
	can show and to provide an easy way to add new scenes. One way to ensure a working scene flow (allowing the 
	user to go back and forth between scenes) is to use a stack of scene.

	Another thing to consider is that sometimes multiple scenes must be visible. Thus when render, we will render
	from back to front of a stack (kinda like layers)

	For more information: https://bell0bytes.eu/scene-manager/

	Approach 2:
	Use Facade or Mediator design pattern
